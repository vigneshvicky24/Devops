To check git is installed or not 
    git --version

To install the git
    apt install -y git

To config the git to the local machine
    git config --global user.name "<username of the git account>"
    git config --global user.email <mail id of the git account>
    git config --global core.editor vim

To see all config ones
    git config --list

To config one in the path called "./git/config"
    cat ./git/config

To  make directory
    mkdir <dir_name>

get into the directory
    cd <dir-name>
Then initialize repository
    git init
to execute status command
    git status
now we can see the .git directory

COMMIT THE FILE
    1.It is the time to inform git, that we wish to stage our changes. to do so, execute command
        git add <file-name>
    2.then see the status
        git status
    3.It creates a new Git commit with the message.
        git commit -m "what message should be display"

REMOVE FILE FROM COMMIT
    1.remove particular file from commit 
        gir rm --cached <file-name>
    2.to see status
        git status
    3.What if ,we have more files want remove from commit 
        git rm --cached -r .
    4.restore previous state of the file
        We successfully reset the file to the state from previous commit, using git checkout. In this way we do the checkout of the last indexed state of this file on current branch.In similar way like in some scenarios before, we can remove all changes in one short command. Let's do it.
        
            git checkout .

HEAD - HEAD is just a label that tells Git which commit you are standing on.

    Text editor for create message for commit

        git commit <file-name>

To set vim as default editor
    git config --global core.editor "vim"


REVERT CHANGES 
    Let's move ourselves back by one commit.

    git revert --no-edit HEAD
    The --no-edit flag tells Git to use the default commit message for the revert commit without opening an editor.

    example:
        What happens when you run it:

Git looks at Commit A.
        Creates a new commit that undoes whatever Commit A did.
        Opens an editor so you can write a message for this new commit.
    


CHECK THE CHANGES BETWEEN COMMITS
    git diff <commit id1> <commit id2>
    git diff HEAD~1 HEAD

git show - detailed information about a specific commit
    git show 
    git show <commit id>

To see the detailed information of the previous commit
    clear && git log --oneline
    --oneline shows only most important info about commits. You have only hash and commit message.

    To show ore details about last commits
        git log -p

    git log --stat

    Maybe you wish to see the information sorted by author of the commits?
        git shortlog


    git log --graph
    git log --oneline --graph 



CONFLICT
    Conflicts can happen. If some number of people are working on the same project, they might work on the same file at the sime time. And then, when you try to commit, or merge, you find out that something called conflict was created.


    1.solve conflict    
    #when combined two branches and found conflict in a file
    2.open the file and resolve the conflict
        git add <file-name>
    3.commit the changes
        git commit -m "message about conflict resolution"   
    

GIT TAG - A tag in Git is a label you attach to a specific commit. It's often used to mark important points in a project's history, like releases (e.g., v1.0, v2.0).
To create a tag
    git tag <tag-name>
To create an annotated tag
    git tag -a v1.0 -m "version 1.0"
To see the details of a tag
    git show <tag-name>
To list all tags
    git tag
To delete a tag
    git tag -d <tag-name>


GIT BRANCH - A branch in Git is a separate line of development in a repository. It allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase (usually the "main" or "master" branch).
To create a new branch
    git branch <branch-name>
To switch to a branch
    git checkout <branch-name>
To create and switch to a new branch in one command
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
To list all branches
    git branch
To delete a branch
    git branch -d <branch-name>

MERGE BRANCHES:
    1.Switch to the branch you want to merge into (e.g., main)
        git checkout main
    2.Merge the other branch into the current branch
        git merge <branch-name>
    3.Resolve any conflicts if they arise, then commit the merge if necessary
STASH - Git stash is a way to save your uncommitted changes temporarily so you can work on something else, and then come back and reapply those changes later.
To stash your changes
    git stash
To list stashed changes
    git stash list
